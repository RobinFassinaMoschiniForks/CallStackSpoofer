# CallStackSpoofer

This repository demonstrates a PoC implementation to spoof arbitrary call stacks when making system calls. For a full technical walkthrough please see
the accompanying blog post here: .

By default it contains three sample call stacks to mimic, which can be selected via supplying either `--wmi`, `--rpc`, or `--svchost`, as demonstrated below:

![readmeexample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108275364/176182191-23cf273c-f154-411c-a1cf-428a9be323b9.PNG)

These call stacks were obtained by running SysMon with process access events enabled and searching for events where lsass was the target of the handle operation.

NB As a word of caution, this PoC was tested on the following Windows build:
 - 10.0.19044.1706 (21h2)

It has not been tested on any other versions and offsets may obviously vary (and hence break) on different Windows builds.

If you are having trouble, one technique to debug errors is to find the process generating OpenProcess events in SysMon and attach to it in 
WinDbg. Once attached, run `bp ntdll!NtOpenProcess` and when bp is hit run `knf`.

This will display output similar to the below, which will contain full symbol resolution and the correct stack utilisation space (indicated by the 'Memory' column):

 As a note, the total stack space used by the current call site is indicated in the row below (e.g. ntdll!NtOpenProcess only takes up 8 bytes). As stated previously, a complete technical walkthrough is covered in the blog linked at the start of this readme which will explain this (and concepts like Child-SP) in more detail. The values generated by windbg can then be used to correlate with what is being returned by CalculateFunctionStackSize() in the event of any problems.
